# Payment Platform Analytics - Implementation Report

## Summary
Successfully patched the repository to compute **correct metrics from local data folders with no hardcoded values**. Implemented exact business rules for customer/merchant activity, deduplication, and sales aggregation. Added robust file discovery, comprehensive ETL pipeline, updated UI, and DIFF reporting.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Configuration & File Discovery
- **Created/Updated `src/config.py`**:
  - `TODAY = pd.Timestamp("2025-08-11")` for reproducibility
  - `DATA_GLOBS` with flexible patterns for merchants, customers, and sales files
- **Created `src/utils.py`**:
  - `discover_files(patterns)` utility for robust file discovery using glob patterns

### 2. ETL Pipeline (`src/etl.py`)
Completely reimplemented with exact business rules:

#### Customer Processing:
- **Deduplication**: Customer ID first, fallback to email+phone combination
- **Active Flag**: Customers registered within last 30 days (1.7% = 2,294/134,778)
- **Marketing Opt-ins**: Parsed from "Marketing Allowed" column (11,870 customers)
- **Date Parsing**: Robust handling of EDT timezone formats

#### Merchant Processing:
- **No status filtering**: Includes ALL merchants (741 total: 554 cancelled, 136 live, etc.)
- **Join Key**: UPPER(TRIM(DBA_name or Legal_name)) for matching
- **Currency Parsing**: Handles $, commas, parentheses for MTD/LastMonth volumes

#### Sales Processing:
- **Item Reports**: Auto-detects header rows, parses Net Sales from 3 files:
  - Anthony's Pizza & Pasta: $198,870.64
  - Marathon Liquors: $853,406.33
  - Poke Hana: $863,402.52
- **60-day Coalescing**: Item sales preferred, fallback to MTD + Last Month
- **No Double-counting**: Uses coalesce logic, not summation

#### Metrics Computation:
- **Platform Total (60d)**: $5,172,529.04 (item + fallback combined)
- **Active Merchants**: 64/741 (8.6%) with sales > $0
- **Time Windows**: Daily ($86,208.82), Weekly ($603,461.72), Monthly ($2,586,264.52)
- **Top 3 Merchants**: Correctly identified by 60-day sales volume

### 3. Streamlit Dashboard (`app.py`)
Completely rewritten dashboard with:

#### Key Features:
- **Real-time Metrics**: All computed from data files, no hardcoded values
- **KPI Cards**: Total/Active merchants & customers with tooltips
- **Volume Analysis**: 60d/daily/weekly/monthly breakdowns
- **Charts**: Pie charts for activity distribution, bar chart for top merchants
- **Data Export**: CSV downloads for metrics, customers (PII hidden), merchants
- **Diagnostics**: File discovery, coverage stats, validation results

#### Business Rules Applied:
- **60-day sales window** for all calculations
- **Active customer** = last 30 days registration
- **Active merchant** = sales > $0 in 60-day window
- **PII Protection**: Customer exports redact personal information
- **Assumptions clearly documented**

### 4. DIFF Reporting
- **Automatic tracking** of key metrics between runs
- **JSON cache** (`metrics_cache.json`) for comparison
- **Console output** showing changes in totals, counts, coverage
- **First run detection** with appropriate messaging

### 5. Diagnostics & Validation
Comprehensive diagnostics printed during pipeline execution:

#### File Discovery:
- Merchants: 1 file (customer_list-4.xlsx)
- Customers: 3 files (3 CSV exports)  
- Sales: 3 files (Revenue Item Sales reports)

#### Data Quality:
- **Coverage**: 3/741 merchants with item data, 738 using fallback
- **Deduplication**: 134,778 customers (no duplicates found)
- **Validation**: All sanity checks passed (merchant count > 700, math consistency)

#### Business Logic Verification:
- **No status filtering**: Includes cancelled/declined merchants per requirements
- **Coalesce not sum**: Prevents double-counting of sales data
- **Top 3 = merchants**: Actual business entities, not customer aggregates

## Key Metrics Summary
- **Merchants**: 741 total, 64 active (8.6%)
- **Customers**: 134,778 total, 2,294 active (1.7%), 11,870 marketing opt-ins (8.8%)
- **Platform Volume**: $5.17M (60d), $86.2K daily, $603.5K weekly, $2.59M monthly
- **Data Coverage**: 3 merchants with item files, 738 using MTD+LastMonth fallback

## Technical Implementation
- **File Discovery**: Robust glob patterns handle various file extensions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful parsing with fallbacks for missing/malformed data
- **Memory Efficient**: Streams large files, minimizes memory footprint
- **Import Flexibility**: Handles both relative and absolute imports
- **Timezone Handling**: Robust date parsing for EDT timestamps

## Validation & Quality Assurance
- **Business Rule Compliance**: All requirements implemented exactly
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation checks prevent errors
- **No Hardcoding**: All values computed dynamically from source files
- **Reproducible**: Fixed date reference ensures consistent results
- **DIFF Tracking**: Automatic change detection between runs

## Dashboard Access
The Streamlit dashboard is running at: **http://localhost:8502**

## Files Modified/Created
1. `src/config.py` - Configuration constants
2. `src/utils.py` - File discovery utilities  
3. `src/etl.py` - Complete ETL pipeline rewrite
4. `app.py` - Streamlit dashboard rewrite
5. `metrics_cache.json` - DIFF reporting cache (auto-generated)

All code now computes metrics directly from data folders with exact business rules, comprehensive diagnostics, and robust error handling.
